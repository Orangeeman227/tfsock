This is the concept art of my idea for the game, the video will show the command blocks that hold the code. basically the way it works is by
having things called scoreboards that basically work as variables since minecraft doesnt have actual variables. When one wave ends it adds to a scoreboard, there are blocks 
that constantly check to see if a scoreboard value is met that sets off a new chain,they are basically if statements.
</p>
<p>
The game runs on a wave system that stops the wave when you reach a certain amount of kills.
</p>

<p>
The  pacing of the game is to be somewhat stressful during the combat but have moments of relaxation when you finish the wave and can go to the shop and get loot.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the loot, the balance of the game in regards to loot is such that there are many options of the loot that you get for the money you earn at the end of a wave. If you only do easy waves, you can only afford one tier up of a certain part of your kit (armour or sword.) but if you only do hard mode then you can afford one tier up of equipment and another upgrade (ex. If you have a tier 3 sword and tier 2 armour, you can afford to get a tier 4 sword and tier 3 armour, or you could just get tier 4 armour with left over money for potions.) The money is scaled such that there are tons of ways to play the game.

The whole map stays consistant in the roman colosseum style, I downloaded the map from:
