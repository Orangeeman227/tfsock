	<p>I feel as though the government should have a fairly large role in determining what users on a private platform can and cannot say. At the end of the day all that matters to companies under a capitalist system is their bottom line. Since the free market has shown that it is incapable of solving the issue of misinformation, I think it is time for the government to step in. The only reason a company would choose to deplatform a user for spreading misinformation would be if it makes them more money and we have not seen that happen. 
</p>
	<p>The consequences of letting misinformation run unchecked results in <i> bad faith actors </i>
<div class = "quote">
"Acting in bad faith is an act of intentional dishonesty that occurs from someone not fulfilling their legal obligations, deliberately misleading someone,
 entering into an agreement with them with no intention of fulfilling the obligations, or violating the basic principles of honesty in your dealings with others." 
 (upcounsel, 2019)
</div>
Bad faith media create two types of people, those who spread misinformation, either knowingly or without having done reasonable research, and those who willingly consume media that they know has been unfairly reported.
</p>

<p>
In Canada  we do not give citizens the right of free speech, the government recognizes that there is certain speech that infringes on the rights of other citizens. So, overall Canada is comfortable silencing some ideas for the good of society. To me there are two factors that go into the decision of creating a law impacting speech for a potential good, the morality and the enforcement of the proposed rules.

</p>

<p>
 As for the morality of mandating companies monitoring bad faith actor, depending on what moral theory you ascribe to, your answer may vary.
 I am myself a rule-utilitarian, so I want to craft rules for society to follow that produces the best results (happiness generally).
 Another way to think of it is  that everyone in society signs a contract that is meant to mutually benefit everyone.)
 I feel as though no one would willingly sign a contract to have misinformation fed to them, 
 it is only when people have their beliefs challenged that they push back on a reliable media, ex.
 People wanting to keep Breitbart platformed even though it intentionally or not, spreads objectively incorrect (I will touch more on Breitbart later.) 
 However, since we live in a democracy we have to appeal to the morality of the general public.
 Since the general public does not ascribe to any mainstream normative ethical theory, I thought it could be essentially boiled down to what is fair or deserving. 
 Appealing to this ideology, you could say that no one <a class = "bold">deserves</a> to be lied to and the people trying to do harm deserve repercussions.
 No ethical person should favour the continued allowance of lying in media but personal biases (and bluntly, unethical people) stop this progress from being made.
 The repercussions would not even be severe enough to warrant the continuation of spreading lies.
 The government is still allowing you to hold and say opinions, they are just not giving you a platform to spread misleading information to support your opinion.

Secondly, the next component in proposing a bill is the effectiveness and the viability of the bill. 
There is no point to a bill if it is not enforceable. That is why I would want regulations on only empirically proven data to remove subjectivity. 
Since the leading factor for business in most countries is the bottom line, failure to remedy and enforce a good faith policy would result in economic 
disadvantages (such as increased taxes). The enforcement of this would be similar to that of a police station, anytime a ban is committed there should be 
proper documentation and an appeal system to limit wrongful convictions as much as possible. The B.F.A.s would then be banned from the site in which the 
infraction occurred. 
</p>

<p>
The benefits to removing B.F.A.s would be an honest and productive discourse. With misinterpretation of data out of the way, people can have real
 conversations with real data that gets closer to the objective truth. Another reason we should regulate fake information is that it can affirm biases
 that people already have, if I am an alt righter looking to affirm my beliefs, there are going to be countless articles that misrepresent data to further 
 their point.

The invisible hand of the free market and you:Proponents of the free market will say that if there is a problem with a service 
(like the spreading of misinformation), then the service will fail since people will not want to use it, but what if the system appeals to the inherent 
bias in people to stay on the site?

"there's a deep misalignment between the goals we have for ourselves and the goals our technologies have for us.: (Jame Williams, 2018)
</div>
As James Williams writes in his book “Stand out of our Light: Freedom and Resistance in the Attention Economy”  The goals that the public would naturally have 
and the goals of technologies are vastly different. Obviously people do not want to be misinformed, but it seems to benefit tech giants like Facebook.
 Facebook openly platforms alt-right new source Breitbart, Breitbart which has had countless accusations of inaccurate reporting 

<div class = "quote" >
"That decision has led to politicians, such as Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, to accuse it of allowing misinformation to spread ahead of the 2020 election."
(Duncan, C, 2019, October 26)
</div>
With this in mind it is clear to see that doing nothing is not an option for the sake of honest discourse as the markets can not solve this problem itself.
