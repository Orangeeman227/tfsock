<p> In this I made a static side bar so that it does not scroll while you move through the page, it also shows the page that you are on by highlighting it with white.
The menue also highlights the text as your mouse hovers over it, I learned this through w3 schools. I used a similar color scheem to that of spotify to make it easy
to read for the user. </p>

<p> The hardest part of doing the side bar was getting the div tags and body tags to not mess with eachother. I had a lot of trouble to keep the text from going under the 
sidebar. </p>

<p> I was not sure how to make a login page, so I just used a table </P>

<p> I was running into a problem with my footer getting inserted into my body of text and overlapping itself. I added external links to my twitter and instagram 
and I had a copyright notice. </p>
