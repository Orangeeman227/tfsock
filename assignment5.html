<h1> Optimisation: </h1>

<p>
For Load times I lowered the resolution to be more properly sized on my assignment one page. I did this by compressing the images more and changing the dimensions.
</p>
<p>
I also put in meta tags on all my pages so the text and images scale to mobile devices. When I first did it, the nav bar text got cut off so it got split into two lines, so I had to adjust my code to fix that.
</p>
<p>
Every section of my website is available in just one click (I know crazy). The nav bar on the side stays in place, so if you are scrolling through the website and want to get somewhere else, you don’t need to scroll back up to find anything. The text and the box of the side bar lights up slightly when hovered over with the mouse so the user knows what box they are clicking. The box and text of the page you are on turns to white and light grey to indicate which page you are on within the nav bar. This is all in an effort for the user to not have to click more than once to reach the desired page.
</p>
<p>
For readability, I set the background to a dark grey similar to spotify’s with the text being white to have a 7:1 contrast as the article says (just want to point out that I did this before reading the article so my innate web designer senses happened to choose the ratio as the leading tech business, cementing my incredible taste.)

<h2> Use Cases </h2>
<ol>

  <li>I found no way to get directions to a specific room in trent while staying on the trent website, the best thing I could find was to go to the map and find the building that the room would be in. If someone was to find a specific class room they would either have to use an external website or ask someone in person. The search feature on  the website seemed to be fairly dysfunctional as I searched for a specific room and it gave me an exam schedule, I also searched for find class room which pointed to articles about internships and user guides. To improve upon the website I would add a direct link to classfind.com as it is the only online resource that seems to work for specific rooms.
	</li>
  
  <li>For this I found the search bar was the easiest way to find any relevant information, I was not totally sure what I was looking for, but I found an important dates page for graduate programs. This process could be very confusing for people who try and look through menus as I could not find any relevant information. Even when I found a link called graduate timetable it opened a pdf of a massive document. 

	</li>
  
  <li>Finding grades on Blackboard is very easy as an overview of all your grades is one click away. Finding specific grades from course to course is also easy, when you click on your course there is always a my grades option at the bottom of the left sidebar. There is nothing I would change to how you see your grades, it is very intuitive as to how you get there. The flow of where things are makes sense, the grades of the specific class are under that classes page and not in an obscure location as the trent website does.
	</li>
  
  <li>I found the textbook without the author’s name in seconds, I googled in an incognito tab the design of everyday things textbook, and it immediately came up with an amazon link.

	</li>
  
  <li>Uber is available in Peterborough UK so it should be as easy as calling one to your location from the app.
	</li>
  
  <li>
In the search engine test I looked at a joe biden ad saying the polls all say biden is the best person to defeat trump, the add then showed bar graphs saying that he was more likely to beat trump in four different polls whilst not sighting any sources, I looked up what I thought was the same source and found that they cherry picked the four polls that looked the best, in fact in the emerson poll he loses to trump while candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris do not go negative in favour of Trump. Both search engines were able to feed me the right source, however duckduckgo gave the correct link as the second result instead of the second,  I also used the same query in both engines to improve fairness.
