<p> Generally I like to have a dark theme with a minimal design, in this app I mirrored spotify such that
it is easy on the eyes if you were to just wake up. The difference between the three pictures are that I designed the phone ones for tapping and the desktop one for clicking/mouse
I also had to adjust the top section for the notch.

<p> Page 1:    The design of this site overall is trying to convey a futursitic an sleek design, the goal is for the customer to think "This is some high tech shit"
which tricks them into thinking I know what I'm doing. At the top of the website it has all of the pages in tabs they can switch to, with a title so the 
user knows which one they are switching to, and can find what they want. Also I have the colours such that the entire page is easy to read. This Page has 
a general overview of what I can do and my moto with tech services, which is my job is for you to not need me. The difference between the iphone X and pixel XL 
layouts is that the XL is much wider so I could fit more text without having to shift more lines, and there was more space at the top due to the lack of notch.

<img src = "Images\Page2Pixel.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 1">
<p> Page 2:    This page has my "services" although it is largely just scheduling meetings to help with tech related things, I put a search bar and a "build a PC"
option for people who want to get/learn to build a PC.  I also included a phone number/email for people to contact</p>

<img src = "Images\Page3Pixel.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 1">
<p>  Page 3: This is the regestration page, I did not include a submit button  since all platforms have some way to do that on the native keybord (enter/return) 
I also included a safe password guidline so that my business does not have to deal with breaches in security as often. The design for this section is as minimal as posible 
to make it easier for the technologically challenged customers, this website attracts.

<img src = "Images\Page4X.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 1">
<img src = "Images\Page4Pixel.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 1">
<p>  Page 4: This page is as simple as can be, just a few text boxes and labels for the customer to read, once again, this service does not bring in the most
experienced people when it comes to web surfing so it is very minimal.
</p>

<img src = "Images\Page5Desktop.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 5">
<img src = "Images\Page5X.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 1">
<img src = "Images\Page5Pixel.png" width = "45%" float = "true" alt="Page 1">
<p>  Page 5:This page displays the progress of customers services, (hopfully) this type of information would only be able to be seen from the business end due to security reasons
but the text is in big font which is easy to read at a glance, and stays with the aethstetic of sharp futursitic text.

<p> Page 6: This is a chat room for the client to message the business operator, it has text bubbles and a text box with pre-filled text to let the user know 
what it is for. On the mobile versions I had to condense the chat bubble to make up for the lack of width on the screen.

<p>  Page 7: This is in a sense a simple variable displayer where it outputs the value of certain engagements with posts to let the opperator know what to 
check, this also has the capabilities to display values from any social media, so the I added a tinder tab, unforunately at the time the business operator only
has one match :(
